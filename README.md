# Testing in Elixir

There are libraries you can test your Elixir Code with.  The official library as we all know is [ExUnit Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.html).

To Get a basic walk I suggest you look thru the docs.

The TLDR version of this link -

In an application generated with the `mix` command test files are placed in the `test` folder.

These file need to end in a `*_test.exs` file extension this denotes that it's elixir script file.

Like a lot of other libraries ExUnit has a DSL that's goal is to help you specify in plain english the goal of components of your code.

##### With ExUnit you get these macros.

*Â For General Setup and organizing your tests

`describe`
`setup`
`setup_all`

* These macros do the bulk of the grunt work

`test`
[assert](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v1.5.2/lib/ex_unit/lib/ex_unit/assertions.ex#L101)
`assert_receive`
`capture_io and capture_log`

### Scripts

This is how you run a script test
`$> elixir hello_world_test.exs`

`$> elixir -r **/*_test.exs`

This can get boring pretty quickly.
